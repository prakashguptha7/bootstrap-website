            <h1>Improving your cloud governance</h1>
            <p style="color: #808080;">Many of the large organizations who have high AWS spend are already using Spot. Automated, intelligent instance orchestration is the new emerging technology that is helping AWS customers save an extra 50% on their monthly bills. What you do is leverage spot instances intelligently and rebalance from on-demand to spot. Amazon's own spot fleet will help you achieve this but with certain restrictions.
 
         </p><br><br>
         <p>As lucrative as the cloud is, if you speak to seasoned Engineering leaders, you might hear stories of teams wasting money on the cloud and costs spiralling out of control. It simply goes unnoticed. Costs accrue over time and hide in plain sight under an enormous treasure trove of information.

        </p>
        <p>Have you perused through an AWS Bill?</p><br>
        <p>It is verbose, lengthy and difficult to navigate. AWS details out everything that you've consumed, down to the very last detail.</p><br>
        <p>Public clouds such as AWS bring greater speed and agility to companies but there are trade-offs from a security and cost perspective. Security concerns can be handled through tight access control, encryption and technical artistry. Cost concerns, however, are more challenging.</p><br>
        <p>To make a point - The 2019 State of the Cloud report by Flexera shows that <b>35% of cloud spend is wasted</b>. The report, which surveyed close to a thousand technical professionals across a broad cross-section of organizations (small, medium and large size) about their adoption of cloud computing, reveals that cloud spend is wasted in many ways:</p><br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>horizontal over scaling</b> where you are using too many resources than what is needed</li>
            <li><b>vertical over scaling</b> where you are using a bigger instance size than what is needed</li>
            <li>keeping <b>active unused</b> and idle resources
            </li>            

        </ul><br>
               <p>With the industry as a whole investing more and more into cloud-based workloads, a robust cost governance model is the need of the hour. A poor governance model or lack thereof reflects a lack of cost sensitivity within the organization. With a well thought out <b>cloud cost governance model</b>, leadership teams can stop reacting retrospectively to cost spikes and start managing it pro-actively and predictably.

            </p> <br> 
            <p>Seminal management guru, W Edwards Deming famously said, “You can’t control what you don’t measure.”</p><br>
            
            <p>Getting visibility into your EC2 spend is the first step towards cost optimization. You can gain insights into the spend by leveraging tools like AWS cost explorer. Several SAAS based solutions are now offering usage and spend based dashboards to give AWS customers an at-a-glance-view into cloud spend.

            </p><br>
            <p>Remember, the overarching goal is to move from reactive cost optimization to being proactive, predictive and continuous.

            </p><br>
            <p>Some of the basic building blocks of a robust cloud cost governance model are:</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Tagging</b> of instances to gain greater visibility into usage data and start identifying outliers</li>
                <li><b>Rightsizing</b> of instances to rebalance and reduce inefficiencies arising from wrong instance types or sizes. For example, right sizing against memory when you find that maximum memory utilization over a four-week period is less than 40%.</li>
                <li><b>Turning off instances</b> when they are not in use</li>
                <li><b>Deleting unused instances</b> lying around as remnants from old employees or archived projects</li>
                <li><b>Utilizing Reserved Instances</b> when opportunity permits</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>Bear in mind that the downside to leveraging the discounted RI pricing is, of course, the larger capital outlay and upfront commitment required.</p><br>
             <p>AWS trusted advisor can kick in once your environments have generated enough historical data for it to give accurate, contextual recommendations. This will help you provision resources optimally. Calculate different cost ratios such as on demand vs reserved cost, EBS vs EC2 cost, EBS snapshot vs EBS volume cost to derive further insight into spend efficiency.</p><br>
                        
               <p>Engineering and finance teams must work together to rebalance cloud usage and optimize the price-performance ratio for their specific cloud environments. Managing cloud cost is a continuous process of analysing, rebalancing, eliminating and automating, where possible.

            </p>  <br> 
            <p>By this point, your cost optimization efforts have started paying some dividends and your cloud bills have decreased. You are using a combination of AWS tools, third party SAAS solutions and adhering to best practices to lower costs. However, it's likely that your efforts will start plateauing out, making it increasingly difficult to unlock the next quantum of savings.

            </p><br>
            <p>How then can cloud cost optimisation still be taken to the next level? What are some of the advanced techniques?  </p><br>
            <h3>Leveraging Spot.</h3>
            <p>Automated, intelligent instance orchestration is the new emerging technology that is helping AWS customers to significantly reduce their monthly AWS bills. You can now leverage Spot Instances even for your HA applications. What you do is leverage spot instances intelligently and switch from on-demand to spot. You can now These addresses certain restrictions on leveraging Spot Fleet.

            </p><br>
            <p>Intelligent instance orchestration from companies like Xosphere, will let you get the reliability of on-demand at the price of spot. Using these orchestration tools is quite easy if your environment is already running auto scaling groups or has container driven architecture.</p><br>
